1. Main size -> horizontal length
2. Cross size -> veritical length
3. Flex container is big box inside it we have a multiple flex items

left veritical line is called main start, while right one is main end
same thing with the above horizontal line is called Cross start and below one called Cross end.

while direction is horizontal main axis is horizonhorizontal and tal and cross axis is veritical in nature

flex box default direction is horizontal

to make any container flexbox we initialize it with display: flex; 

flexbox properties

flex-direction: row by default and column we can give;
there is row- reverse and column reverse will reverse the order of 1,2,3,4

justify-content: flex-start , flex-end and centre 

align-item: centre flex-end , flex-start 

both justify-content in horizontal and align-item move the items in vertical manner 

use console to check the other properties, very useful

another property of flex container is flex-wrap : wrap it will make it responsive in nature

flex-flow : column wrap; here we can give the 2 properties at the same time flex-direction and flex-wrap

flex-item properties

first make an different class for different flex-item so that you can see the 
differences

order: 3 -> if we assign the order to any item then it will come last in order
suppose we give item1 order of 3 and item2 order of 4 then item will come last

flex-grow: 1 by default but we can change it and it will increase the width of it. we can give the value in decimals also

flex-shrink: 2 -> when we shrink the page layout in then on item on which it is applied will shrink the most in comparision to others

align-self: centre it will disregard the properties set by flex-box container
will behave according to align-self
